This project demonstrates a simplistic way to use MediaPipe pose detection, a laptop, a laptop webcam, an Arduino and a piezoelectric buzzer to automatically detect when a person is experiencing an epileptic seizure. When the seizure is detected, the system triggers an audible alarm to call for help.
